## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors

:root {
    --night-deep: #0a0a1e;
    --warm-lantern: #ffb347;
    --cool-neon: #00d9ff;
    /* etc. */
}
```

### Updating Content

All content is directly in the HTML files. Just open them in a text editor and modify:

- **Personal info**: Edit the text in each section
- **Projects**: Update the `.project-card` sections
- **Skills**: Modify the `data-skill` percentages
- **Contact**: Update email and social links

### Adding Images

While this version uses SVG graphics and gradients, you can add images:

1. Create an `assets/images/` folder
2. Add your images
3. Reference them in HTML: `<img src="assets/images/your-image.jpg">`

## 📱 Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers

## 💡 Tips

- The lanterns are animated with CSS - no JavaScript needed for basic floating
- Particles are dynamically generated on page load
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- The navigation adapts to mobile with a hamburger menu

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Navigation disappears when scrolling:**
- This should be fixed! Nav has `position: fixed` and `z-index: 1000`

**Pages look blank:**
- Check that all files are in the correct folders
- Make sure `styles.css` and `main.js` paths are correct

**Fonts not loading:**
- You need an internet connection for Google Fonts
- Or download fonts locally and update the CSS
