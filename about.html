                        I'm <strong>captaincto</strong>, an aspiring developer and artist. I still have lots to learn, 
                        but I'm passionate about building projects that are useful, beautiful, and meaningful. 
                        Someday I have to fulfill one of my childhood dreams: either to become an artist, start a business 
                        in San Francisco, or learn a succulent recipe. But for now, I'm trying to make sure to get rid of those bugs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="content-text">
                        My journey started when I was playing Brawl Stars in 2018 and got curious about the creative aspect of the game. 
                        Back then, I had no idea what coding was, but I thought that the game and the art style looked cool and 
                        I wanted to make my own video game. Seriously, playing video games has benefits.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="content-text">
                        After all of that brawling, I'm still debugging, coding, and figuring things out. But now I can build real projects. 
                        I can make a website like this one. I can create art online. Creating projects from scratch takes a lot of time 
                        and effort, but it's worth it at the end to see the fruits of my labor. 
                    </p>

                <div class="content-section">

                    <div class="section-decoration"></div>
                    
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Craft over speed.</strong> I'd rather spend an extra hour making something beautiful and thoughtful 
                        than rush out something functional but soulless. Every project is a chance to create an experience, not just 
                        a product.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Learning over knowing.</strong> I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" or "Let me figure that out." 
                        Being intermediate means I'm past the basics but far from mastery—and that's exciting. There's so much room 
                        to grow.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Culture and code.</strong> Technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. The apps we build, the interfaces we 
                        design, the stories we tell through our work—they all carry culture, history, and meaning. I want my projects 
                        to honor where I come from while pushing toward what's possible.

                        I like writing and reading about all sorts of things. 
                        Trying out activities that are outside of my comfort zone is always exciting.
                        Walking around, especially in a new place, is also fun.

                    <p class="content-text">
                        Sometimes I dream about visiting all 7 continents. But going to Antarctica to see the penguins is quite expensive. 
                        At least 10,000 dollars per person. With that amount of money, I could probably max out a Brawl Stars account. 
                        Still, learning about different cultures and seeing different places sounds nice.

                        Did I tell you that I also like Teddy Bears? Search up "Sam the Teddy" on the internet. 
                        Surely you won't be disappointed.
